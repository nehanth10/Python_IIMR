# Python Inheritance

# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class.
